## Objective

To read the details in game type ">talk to dispatcher".
The quest is about finding a troll thats inside one of the rooms, killing it, and returning its head back to the dispatcher.
Once this is done the game will successfully be finished.
If the main character dies at some point the game will end in a defeat.

There are various secondary objectives, like completing side quests or collecting better gear. Not all connections will be unlocked or unblocked at the beggining, the player must have to figure out how to get through the obtacles.
